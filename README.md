# PyBer_Analysis
Ride sharing data analysis, Matplotlib, Module 5. 

## Overview of the analysis: 
As a new employee of PyBer ride sharing we were tasked with determining the relationship between the type of city: urban, rural and suburban, and a number of different factors such as number of drivers, total fares, number of rides, etc. Below we will also specifically be looking at the total weekly fares broken down by each city type. This revenue breakdown will be very benifical for making decisions. 

## Results: 
There are large differences in the quantity of data amoung city types. To begin with the total number of rides the urban area had 1,625 rides, suburban 625 or roughly 62% less rides, and the rural area only had 125 rides or roughly 98% less rides that the urban area ![Total_Ride_By_Type.JPG](C:\Users\Sydney Kieswetter\Class\PyBer_Analysis\Resources).  The large discrepancy in the number of rides was also echoed when analysing the number of drivers. Urban driver count was 2,405, 490 drivers in suburban areas, and only 78 in rural areas ![Driver_count.JPG](C:\Users\Sydney Kieswetter\Class\PyBer_Analysis\Resources). Finally when looking at the revenure, or sum of fares, the urban area has a stagering $39,854.38 made in fares, suburban a comfortable $19,365.33 and rural only has $4,327.93 ![Fare_Sum.JPG](C:\Users\Sydney Kieswetter\Class\PyBer_Analysis\Resources).

### Weekly Overview
It is interesting to see that the data in all three city types generally follows the same pattern. Fares or revenues peak in the sames seasons/ weeks every year and drop off at the same time as well. However the graph of weekly fare revenue still reinforces the fact that rural cities do not utilize ride sharing nearly as much as suburban cities, or no where near as much as urban ![Weekly_Fare.JPG](C:\Users\Sydney Kieswetter\Class\PyBer_Analysis\Resources).

## Summary 
Biggest disparity is the number of rides from rural areas. Some reccomendations to grow that area of the business could be customer promotions for example half priced drives to rural areas on Friday nights, or larger tips for drivers if they attend to customers in rural areas. Finally the CEO could decide that compared to the large number of customers and therefore rides and revenue in urban areas it is not very profitable to focus on the rural areas, and the business should cut spending in that market.
